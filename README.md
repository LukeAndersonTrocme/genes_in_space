# On the Genes, Genealogies, and Geographies of Quebec

This github repository contains supplementary code related to a manuscript entitled "On the Genes, Genealogies, and Geographies of Quebec".

[A PDF of the manuscript](https://github.com/LukeAndersonTrocme/genes_in_space/blob/main/genes_in_space.pdf) can be found in the main directory of this repository.

The Supplementary Code directory contains three folders :

 - [cross_coalescence](https://github.com/LukeAndersonTrocme/genes_in_space/tree/main/supplementary_code/cross_coalescence) folder contains the code used to compute the genealogically based coalescence rates.

 - [data_viz](https://github.com/LukeAndersonTrocme/genes_in_space/tree/main/supplementary_code/data_viz) folder contains a number of R scripts used to generate the main figures of manuscript

 - [watershed_enrichment](https://github.com/LukeAndersonTrocme/genes_in_space/tree/main/supplementary_code/watershed_enrichment) folder contains the code used to compute the watershed enrichment of the three metrics in Figure 3.

We also provide a link to Zenodo which house the freely available results of simulations shown in figure 2: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6839683
